	<h3>Description</h3>

		<p>This is an easy grilled peach dessert! I use a honey nut flavored cream cheese spread and it's wonderful! Drizzle a little extra honey after they're grilled and they're perfect!</p>

	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		
		<ul>
			<li>4 peaches, halved and pitted</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons clover honey</li>
			<li>1 cup soft cream cheese with honey and nuts</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Steps</h3>
	
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat a grill for medium-high heat</li>
			<li>Brush peaches with a light coating of oil. Place pit side down onto the grill.</li>
			<li>Grill for 5 minutes, or until the surfaces have nice grill marks.</li>
			<li>Turn the peaches over, and drizzle with a bit of honey. Place a dollop of the cream cheese spread in the place where the pit was.</li>
			<li>Grill for 2 to 3 more minutes or untill the filling is warm. Serve immediately</li>
