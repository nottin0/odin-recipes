	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	
		<ul>
			<li>Italian Sausage: Sweet Italian sausage is perfect for this top-rated recipe. To turn up the heat a bit, try using half hot Italian sausage.</li>

			<li>Butter: Two tablespoons of butter is all you'll need to saut√© the veggies. Of course, you could substitute olive oil if you prefer.</li>

			<li>Onions: Slice one yellow onion and half of one red onion. If you prefer a milder flavor, just use one and a half yellow onions.</li>

			<li>Garlic: Mince four cloves of fresh garlic to add to the vegetable mixture for authentic Italian flavor.</li>

			<li>Bell Peppers: Slice one red pepper and one green bell pepper.</li>

			<li>Spices and Seasonings: This sausage and peppers recipe is simply seasoned with dried basil and dried oregano.</li>	

			<li>Wine: Opt for a dry white wine such as pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc. If you don't have any wine on hand, reviewers say they've had success substituting with chicken broth or beer.</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h3>Steps</h3>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Cook sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until brown on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from skillet, and slice. </li>
